# Tik-Tak-Toe
Welcome to my version of Tik-Tak-Toe! This project was undertaken to help develop a good understanding of javascript and how to implement factory function and modules. It was built using Javascript with Bulma integrated for styling.

## About this Project
The main aim of this project was to gain experience building a game system. To organise code and utilise factory function and modules to do this. I also wanted to add an AI component with varying levels of difficulty and this was achieved through the use of recurssion.

## Features
**Player vs Player** - Challenge a friend to a 1 on 1.  
**Player vs AI** - Take on the AI at varying levels of difficulty.  
**Interactive Interface** - Easy-to-use console interface for a seamless gaming experience.  
**Winning Logic** - The game includes an intelligent algorithm to determine the winner.
